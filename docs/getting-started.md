# Getting started

## Build

```
make setup   # npm install
make build   # bundle the CLI, the studio's bpmn-js bundles, and Tailwind CSS
```

(Under Nix: `nix develop --command make build`.)

## Set up

```
make init
```

Copies the bundled graph library (`workflows/*.bpmn`) into
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/graph-agent/workflows`, and writes a starter
`config.toml`. The graph library is shared across every project on the
machine; sessions are recorded under `$XDG_STATE_HOME/graph-agent`, one
directory per session, each tagged with the project it ran in.

## Run the Pi demo loop, without a model

`pi-default-loop` -- the default graph -- is a drawn transcription of Pi's own
`runLoop()`: an outer follow-up loop wrapped around an inner turn loop, with
every branch runLoop makes (steering injection, the truncated-tool-batch
path, the batch-terminate rule, `prepareNextTurn`, `shouldStopAfterTurn`)
visible as its own activity. `workflows/workflows.test.ts` pins every one of
those branches against the diagram, so it cannot silently drop one.

`--dry-run` walks a graph with a scripted model that answers once and stops --
no credentials, no network, the fastest way to see whether a graph does what
its author meant:

```
$ graph-agent run "say hello" --dry-run
graph  pi-default-loop
model  dry-run (no model called)

  inject_pending  agent:steer  nothing queued
  llm_turn  agent:turn  [dry run] no model was called.
  drain_followup  agent:follow-up  no follow-up

session 08c358d7  completed  1 turn(s)
```

To run against a real model instead, authenticate with Pi first (`pi`, then
`/login`) and drop `--dry-run`.

## A deterministic step: `shell`

Every activity in a graph dispatches to a **harness** -- `agent:turn` for a
model call, `agent:tool` for one of the tools the model asked to run,
`graph:extend` for a self-splice, and so on (see the [harness
reference](harnesses.html)). `shell` is the deterministic one: no model call, just
a command and its exit status, for the parts of a graph that should not be
left to a model's self-report.

`workflows/shell-demo.bpmn` pairs the two: one Pi turn, then a shell step that
verifies something about the workspace, gated on the exit code.

```
$ graph-agent run "verify this workspace" --dry-run --graph shell-demo
graph  shell-demo
model  dry-run (no model called)

  turn  agent:turn  [dry run] no model was called.
  verify  shell  `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` exited 0

session 257de4d0  completed  1 turn(s)
```

The command lives in a `zeebe:taskHeaders` `command` header on the activity
(`element_templates/shell_task.json` is the studio's property panel for it);
`fail_on_error` (default `true`) decides whether a non-zero exit fails the
activity outright or just publishes the exit code for a gateway to route on.
Swap the header for whatever the graph should actually confirm -- a test run,
a lint, a build -- rather than the placeholder `git rev-parse` check.

## The studio

```
graph-agent studio
```

serves a BPMN editor and a session viewer scoped to the project you run it
from: the graph library on one side, this project's sessions on the other.
Opening `/graph?id=shell-demo` shows the diagram above in the modeler, with
the Camunda 8 element templates (including "Shell Command") available from
the properties panel. See the [screenshots on the front page](index.html).

`scripts/screenshot-docs.mjs` produces the screenshots in this repo's own
`docs/` by driving the real CLI and a real Chromium against a throwaway
workspace -- run it after any studio change to refresh them.
